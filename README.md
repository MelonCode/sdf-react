Just in case, you can find my learning notes [here](https://nikitarudy.notion.site/GLSL-Learning-e503fbf599a440e6889426644ae13d3e)

### Running on your machine

This project uses Yarn and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Project would start on port `3000`

### Routing

This project is using custom made NextJS-inspired routing.

It's mostly based on article from omarelhawary's blog, but slightly tweaked and adapted for use with React Router 6
